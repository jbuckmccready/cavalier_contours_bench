# Cavalier Contour Benchmarks

## Summary

Repository for running benchmarks for the
[cavalier_contours](https://github.com/jbuckmccready/cavalier_contours) library. This is a separate
repository to avoid bloat, additional compile time, and general issues with depending on criterion
in the library repository.
